This question was easy since i had become familiar with http request . i had first some difficulty with connecting to the wifi. i used another lap and then found the properties and got the ip address . then after pasting this in the browser i went to a website showing wired . then after using chatgpt i got that the format is .txt then i asked chettan and he said the clue is the name. so i guessed its robots.txt . after that i got a page with lots of random text . then i searched words with controlF like flags, wired and then got the answer.
